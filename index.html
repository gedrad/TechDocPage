            <p>Welcome to our front-end web developer learning pathway!</p>
            <p>Here we provide you with a structured course that will teach you all you need to know to become a front-end web developer. Work through each section, learning new skills (or improving existing ones) as you go along. Each section includes exercises and assessments to test your understanding before you move forward.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Subjects_covered">
            <header><h2>Subjects covered</h2></header>
            <p>The subjects covered are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic setup and learning how to learn</li>
                <li>Web standards and best practices (such as accessibility and cross-browser compatibility)</li>
                <li>HTML, the language that gives web content structure and meaning</li>
                <li>CSS, the language used to style web pages</li>
                <li>JavaScript, the scripting language used to create dynamic functionality on the web</li>
                <li>Tooling that is used to facilitate modern client-side web development.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can work through sections in order, but each one is also self-contained. For example, if you already know HTML, you can skip ahead to the CSS section.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Prerequisites">
            <header><h2>Prerequisites</h2></header>
            <p>You don't need any previous knowledge to start this course. All you need is a computer that can run modern web browsers, an internet connection, and a willingness to learn.</p>
            <p>If you are not sure if front-end web development is for you, and/or you want a gentle introduction before starting a longer and more complete course, work through our Getting started with the web module first.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Getting_help">
            <header><h2>Getting help</h2></header>
            <p>We have tried to make learning front-end web development as comfortable as possible, but you will probably still get stuck because you don't understand something, or some code is just not working.</p>
            <p>Don't panic. We all get stuck, whether we are beginner or professional web developers. The Learning and getting help article provides you with a series of tips for looking up information and helping yourself. If you are still stuck, feel free to post a question on our Discourse forum.</p>

                <p>Let's get started. Good luck!</p>

            <p>The documentation is taken from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer">MDN.</a></p>

        <section class="main-section" id="The_code_element">
            <header><h2>The code element</h2></header>
            <p>The code element represents a fragment of computer code. This could be an XML element name, a filename, a computer program, or any other string that a computer would recognize.</p>
                   
            <p>There is no formal way to indicate the language of computer code being marked up. Authors who wish to mark code elements with the language used, e.g. so that syntax highlighting scripts can use the right rules, can use the class attribute, e.g. by adding a class prefixed with "language-" to the element.</p>
                    
            <p>The following example shows how the element can be used in a paragraph to mark up element names and computer code, including punctuation.</p>
                                    
            <p>The <code>code</code> element represents a fragment of computer
                    code.</p>
                    
            <p>When you call the <code>activate()</code> method on the
                    <code>robotSnowman</code> object, the eyes glow.</p>
                    
            <p>The example below uses the <code>begin</code> keyword to indicate
                    the start of a statement block. It is paired with an <code>end</code>
                    keyword, which is followed by the <code>.</code> punctuation character
                    (full stop) to indicate the end of the program.</p>
